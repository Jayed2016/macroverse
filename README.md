# Macroverse
## An entire universe on the Ethereum blockchain

Macroverse is a project to deploy a procedurally-generated universe to the Ethereum blockchain, suitable for use as a setting for games and a subject for exploration.

Players will be able to own a token, MRV, that provides access to this procedural world. Players will also be able to claim and trade pieces of virtual real estate, with in-game benefits in supported games.

For full details, see the [whitepaper](MacroverseWhitepaper.pdf) and read the [smart contracts](https://github.com/NovakDistributed/macroverse/tree/master/contracts).
